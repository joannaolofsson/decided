## Decided - an MVP for reducing everyday decision fatigue

Decided is an MVP designed to reduce the number of small decisions you need to make each day by planning ahead. The first version focuses on wardrobe choices. Future iterations will expand to other everyday decisions such as makeup, beauty products, and similar routines.

## What the application does?

The app lets you:

* Add clothing items you own
* Add items you’re considering buying
* Filter your wardrobe by brand, ownership status, and price
* Plan and simplify your daily outfit decisions

This creates a small, structured system that reduces decision fatigue and helps you stay intentional about what you wear.

## Tech used

* Next.js and TypeScript for the application
* Supabase for authentication and database
* Tailwind CSS for styling

## Why I build this

I built Decided because I personally need a simple way to plan my wardrobe and reduce the number of small decisions that take up mental space. This project is part of a larger idea around supporting ADHD‑friendly decision‑making through structure, clarity, and planning ahead.
